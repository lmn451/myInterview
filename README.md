## In this task you will create a giphy client which will make a search by image name and display it.

1. Implement dynamic search input with debounce.
2. Loading should be implemented in the logic and the UI.
   (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton)
3. 9 search results will be displayed.
4. Each result is clickable and will open in a different route
   with full image with its details (title, image dimensions).
5. Bonus points for a nice and sleek UI ;)
6. Add infinite scrolling to the index search page (Opt.)
